# First Render
Here is the first render of our Daisy Seed Breakout Board :

![2D perspective of breakout board](docs/images/Charge-Seed-1st-Render.png)

The goal is to create a breakout board that contains the reference information that you need to work with the Daisy Seed.

It's hard to tell without a 3D perspective, but those are female headers for the seed to plug into with both male and female headers available to use as well as screw terminal blocks.

Constructive [feedback](https://github.com/orgs/clectric-diy/discussions/39) is welcome!
